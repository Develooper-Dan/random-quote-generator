# random-quote-generator
A small project originally developed with CodePen for the Frontend Libraries Certification at https://www.freecodecamp.org/ and then modified to be uploaded to Github and also to improve the user experience by adding the possibility to post the quotes on facebook for instance.

### Getting started
In the project directory, both of the following commands must be run in order:

#### `npm install`

This will download all the projects dependencies listed in the respective package.json files and install them locally. If you're unfamiliar with npm, you might want to visit https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/ for further reference.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Usage

Pretty obvious. Get a new random quote every time you click the "New Quote"-button and show it to whom ever it might not concern with the social media icons!

### Credits
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The quotes used were kindly provided by STANDS4 APIs (https://www.quotes.net/api.php).

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own Random Quote Generator!
